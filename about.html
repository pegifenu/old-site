  <div class="title">About</div>
  <p>Hello, I'm a programmer and artist currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at UCLA. On the Internet, I go by Pegifenu, which can be shortened to Peg.</p>
  <p>
    I have a broad interest in software engineering, spanning front-end development, back-end systems, and machine learning. I am especially enthusiastic about game development.
  </p>
  <p>
    When it comes to art, I am drawn to animation, more specifically storyboarding. I believe that some of its most important aspects of a creative work are its story and messages.
  </p>  
  </p>
  <p>
    My aspiration is to one day create something meaningful that not only resonates with me but also has the ability to impact people's emotions and perspectives on the world.
